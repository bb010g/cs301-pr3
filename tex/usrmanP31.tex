{\bf Program Description:}
Finds 3-move mates in a given chess problem.

{\bf Use of the Program:}
Provide a valid chess board in FEN as the file {\tt position.fen}. Output will
be appended to {\tt solutions.txt}. The input in FEN and a visualization
of the board will be output, followed by a list of checkmates that can be
reached in 3 moves. Each checkmate listed will consist of a visualization
of the board state at the end of the game and the series of moves used to
get there. Each white move will put black in check. The more memory you can
give to the JVM, the faster this will probably run. This program evaluates
all possible valid chess moves.

{\bf Bugs:}
The 50-move rule is not followed. However, this is not solvable with just a FEN
input due to it not keeping track of when the last capture or pawn movement was.
This would be easily implementable with an extension to FEN.
